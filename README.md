## Get Started

### Setup Dependencies

Use [Bun](https://bun.sh) for dependency management and scripts. Ensure [Bun is installed](https://bun.sh/docs/installation):

```sh
curl -fsSL https://bun.sh/install | bash
# or use any preferred installation methods
```

Install dependencies:

```sh
bun install
```

### Code Quality

Check, format, lint to ensure the setup is fine:

```sh
bun check
```

If want to automatically format & lint the code:

```sh
bun write
```

### Environment Variables

Create the `.env` file from `.env.example`. This is only for local development, not production:

```sh
cp -i .env.example .env
```

Configure the required environment variables if on local, otherwise in the project settings on other environments.

If necessary, create the `.env.prod` for production info. Adjust accordingly if needed for `staging`, `test`, etc. Be careful to change the `URL` variables on different domains and subdomains.

```sh
cp -i .env.example .env.prod
```

Then change all the examples.

Required for application:

- `VITE_APP_NAME`
- `VITE_APP_URL`
- `APP_URL`
- `DOMAIN`
- `BETTER_AUTH_SECRET`
- `DATABASE_URL`

Required when using Docker Compose:

- `POSTGRES_USER`
- `POSTGRES_PASSWORD`
- `POSTGRES_DB`
- `POSTGRES_HOST_PORT`

Optional for OAuth and Payment:

- `*_CLIENT_ID` and `*_CLIENT_SECRET`: For OAuth related, [check Guide: OAuth](./docs/GUIDE_OAUTH.md)
- `*_ACCESS_TOKEN` and `*_WEBHOOK_SECRET` for payment related.

### Database Setup

Prisma ORM is used to communicate with the database easily.

The default is PostgreSQL from local system, Docker container, or with services like Prisma Postgres, Neon, Supabase.

Start local database with Docker Compose:

```bash
bun db:up
```

Migrate database:

```sh
bun db:migrate
```

Seed initial data:

```sh
bun db:seed
```

Open Prisma Studio:

```sh
bun db:studio
```

Reset when needed:

```sh
bun db:reset
```

### Development

Run the development server:

```sh
bun dev
```

Open <http://localhost:8000> then we're ready.

Note: This repo has `.vscode/settings.json` which has `"files.exclude"` to hide some configs and build assets. Reconfigure it as needed.

### Production Deployment

Pick a host to deploy and setup accordingly, such as:

- [Railway.com](https://railway.com)
- [Render.com](https://render.com)
- [Vercel](https://vercel.com)
- [Netlify](https://netlify.com)
- [Fly.io](https://fly.io)
- [Google Cloud (GCP)](https://cloud.google.com)
- [Amazon Web Services (AWS)](https://aws.amazon.com)
- [Microsoft Azure](https://azure.microsoft.com)
- VPS: [Coolify](https://coolify.io), [Dokploy](https://dokploy.com), etc

Notes:

- Railway supports `Dockerfile`.
  - Make sure to use [`Railpack`](https://railpack.com/languages/node/) to have the latest Node.js version.
  - Keep in mind the private network is not available during build time, so have to [migrate during pre-deploy](https://docs.railway.com/guides/pre-deploy-command)
- Render supports `Dockerfile`.
- Vercel needs `vercelPreset` in `react-router.config.ts`.
- It's recommended to use secret management for environment variables, such as [Doppler](https://doppler.com) or [Infisical](https://infisical.com).

### Production Build

Check if the production build is fine:

```sh
bun run build
```

Production build if using Docker (without database migration):

```sh
bun run build:docker
```

Migrate database for production:

```sh
bun db:migrate:deploy
```

Then run:

```sh
bun start
```
